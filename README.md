# Learn Hermes Agent

A teaching repository for implementers who want to understand and rebuild a production-grade autonomous AI agent from scratch.

This repo does not try to mirror every product detail from the Hermes Agent codebase. It focuses on the mechanisms that actually decide whether an agent can work autonomously across platforms:

- the conversation loop
- tool registry and dispatch
- session persistence
- prompt assembly
- context compression
- memory and skill management
- skill system
- permission and safety
- multi-platform gateway
- terminal backends
- scheduling
- external capability routing

The goal is simple:

**understand the real design backbone well enough that you can rebuild it yourself.**

## What This Repo Is Really Teaching

One sentence first:

**The model does the reasoning. The harness gives the model a working environment that spans platforms, persists across sessions, and manages its own skills.**

That working environment is made of a few cooperating parts:

- `Agent Loop`: send messages to the model, execute tool calls, append results, continue
- `Tool System`: a self-registering dispatch layer — the agent's hands
- `Session Store`: SQLite with FTS5 — conversation memory that survives restarts
- `Prompt Builder`: assemble system prompts from personality, memory, config, and context
- `Context Compression`: keep the active window small when conversations grow long
- `Memory & Skills`: durable knowledge and agent-managed skill files
- `Permission System`: detect dangerous commands before execution
- `Gateway`: a single agent loop that listens on Telegram, Discord, Slack, WeChat, and more
- `Terminal Backends`: run commands locally, in Docker, over SSH, or on serverless platforms
- `Cron / MCP / Voice`: grow the single-agent core into a full working platform

This is the teaching promise of the repo:

- teach the mainline in a clean order
- explain unfamiliar concepts before relying on them
- stay close to real system structure
- avoid drowning the learner in irrelevant product details

## What This Repo Deliberately Does Not Teach

This repo is not trying to preserve every detail that exists in the production system.

If a detail is not central to the agent's core operating model, it should not dominate the teaching line. That includes things like:

- packaging, Nix flakes, and release mechanics
- landing pages and marketing assets
- enterprise subscription and billing wiring
- telemetry and analytics
- RL training pipeline and batch runner internals
- platform-specific API quirks (WeChat XML parsing, Telegram inline keyboards)
- skin/theme engine cosmetics
- historical migration logic

Those details may matter in production. They do not belong at the center of a 0-to-1 teaching path.

## Who This Is For

The assumed reader:

- knows basic Python
- understands functions, classes, async/await basics
- may be completely new to agent systems or multi-platform bots

So the repo tries to keep a few strong teaching rules:

- explain a concept before using it
- keep one concept fully explained in one main place
- start from "what it is", then "why it exists", then "how to implement it"
- avoid forcing beginners to assemble the system from scattered fragments

## Recommended Reading Order

- Overview: [`docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md`](./docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md)
- Code Reading Order: [`docs/en/s00f-code-reading-order.md`](./docs/en/s00f-code-reading-order.md)
- Glossary: [`docs/en/glossary.md`](./docs/en/glossary.md)

- Data Structures: [`docs/en/data-structures.md`](./docs/en/data-structures.md)

## If This Is Your First Visit, Start Here

Do not open random chapters first.

The safest path is:

1. Read [`docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md`](./docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md) for the full system map.
2. Read [`docs/en/s00d-chapter-order-rationale.md`](./docs/en/s00d-chapter-order-rationale.md) so the chapter order makes sense before you dive into mechanism detail.
3. Read [`docs/en/s00f-code-reading-order.md`](./docs/en/s00f-code-reading-order.md) so you know which source files to open first.
4. Follow the four stages in order: `s01-s06 -> s07-s11 -> s12-s15 -> s16-s20`.
5. After each stage, stop and rebuild the smallest version yourself before continuing.

If the middle and late chapters start to blur together, reset in this order:

1. [`docs/en/data-structures.md`](./docs/en/data-structures.md)
2. [`docs/en/entity-map.md`](./docs/en/entity-map.md)
3. the bridge docs closest to the chapter you are stuck on
4. then return to the chapter body

## Bridge Docs

These are not extra main chapters. They are bridge documents that make the middle and late system easier to understand:

2. `s07-s11`: add intelligence — memory, skills, safety, delegation, and error recovery
3. `s12-s15`: go multi-platform — gateway, adapters, terminal backends, and scheduling
4. `s16-s20`: add advanced capabilities — MCP, browser, voice, vision, and full integration
5. `s21-s25`: self-improvement — skill creation, hooks, trajectory/RL, plugins, and skill evolution

## Chapter Index: What to Focus on in Each Chapter

If this is your first time learning this material systematically, do not spread your attention evenly across all details. For each chapter, focus on 3 things:

1. What new capability this chapter adds.
2. Where the key state lives.
3. After finishing, can you hand-write this minimal mechanism yourself?

## Reading Approaches for Beginners

### Approach 1: Steady Mainline

Best for readers encountering agent systems for the first time.

Read in this order:

`s00 -> s01 -> s02 -> s03 -> s04 -> s05 -> s06 -> s07 -> s08 -> s09 -> s10 -> s11 -> s12 -> s13 -> s14 -> s15 -> s16 -> s17 -> s18 -> s19 -> s20`

### Approach 2: Build First, Complete Later

Best for "get it running, then fill in the gaps" readers.

Read in this order:

1. `s01-s06`: build a core agent with persistence and context compression
2. `s07-s11`: add memory, skills, safety, delegation, and config
3. `s12-s15`: go multi-platform, learn cross-environment execution
4. `s16-s20`: add advanced capabilities, assemble the complete system

### Approach 3: When You Get Stuck

If you hit a wall in the middle or late chapters, do not push forward blindly.

Reset in this order:

1. [`docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md`](./docs/en/s00-architecture-overview.md)
2. [`docs/en/data-structures.md`](./docs/en/data-structures.md)
3. [`docs/en/entity-map.md`](./docs/en/entity-map.md)
4. the chapter you are stuck on

When readers truly get stuck, it is usually not "I can't read the code" but rather:

- which layer does this mechanism plug into?
- which data structure holds this state?
- what is the difference between this term and another that looks similar?

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd learn-hermes-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Then configure your API key in `.env`, and run:

```sh
python agents/s01_agent_loop.py
python agents/s12_gateway.py
python agents/s20_full.py
```

Suggested order:

1. Run `s01` and make sure the minimal loop really works.
2. Read `s00`, then move through `s01 -> s06` in order.
3. Only after the single-agent core plus its persistence feel stable, continue into `s07 -> s11`.
4. Move into gateway and platform chapters `s12 -> s15` only after the core agent makes sense.
5. Read `s20_full.py` last, after the mechanisms already make sense separately.

## How To Read Each Chapter

Each chapter is easier to absorb if you keep the same reading rhythm:

1. what problem appears without this mechanism
2. what the new concept means
3. what the smallest correct implementation looks like
4. where the state actually lives
5. how it plugs back into the loop
6. where to stop first, and what can wait until later

If you keep asking:

- "Is this core mainline or just a side detail?"
- "Where does this state actually live?"

go back to:

- [`docs/en/teaching-scope.md`](./docs/en/teaching-scope.md)
- [`docs/en/data-structures.md`](./docs/en/data-structures.md)
- [`docs/en/entity-map.md`](./docs/en/entity-map.md)

## Repository Structure

```text
learn-hermes-agent/
├── agents/              # runnable Python reference implementations per chapter
├── docs/zh/             # Chinese mainline docs

## Teaching Tradeoffs

To ensure "buildable from 0 to 1", this repo makes deliberate tradeoffs:

- Teach the minimal correct version first, then explain extension boundaries.
- If a real mechanism is complex but the core idea is not, teach the core idea first.
- If an advanced term appears, explain it — do not assume the reader already knows.
- If an edge case in the real system has low teaching value, remove it entirely.

This means the repo aims for:

**High fidelity on core mechanisms, deliberate tradeoffs on peripheral details.**

## Key Differences from Learn Claude Code

Hermes Agent and Claude Code share the same agent paradigm — loop, tools, planning, context — but Hermes has distinct architectural choices worth understanding:

| Aspect | Claude Code | Hermes Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript/Node.js | Python |
| Loop style | Async streaming | Synchronous with bridged async |
| Persistence | File-based memory | SQLite + FTS5 full-text search |
| Multi-platform | CLI only | 15+ platform adapters via gateway |
| Terminal | Local shell | Local, Docker, SSH, Modal, Daytona |
| Skills | Static skill files | Agent-managed skills (create → use → edit) |
| API format | Anthropic-native | OpenAI-compatible (works with 200+ models) |
| Scheduling | In-session cron | Persistent cron with duration strings and cron expressions |

These differences are not cosmetic — they lead to fundamentally different implementation patterns that the teaching chapters explore in detail.

## Language Status

Chinese is the canonical teaching line and the fastest-moving version.

- `zh`: most reviewed and most complete
- `en`: main chapters plus the major bridge docs are available

If you want the fullest and most frequently refined explanation path, use the Chinese docs first.

## End Goal

By the end of the repo, you should be able to answer these questions clearly:

- what is the minimum state an autonomous agent needs to persist across sessions?
- why is the tool registry the center of the agent's capability?
- how does a single conversation loop scale to 15+ messaging platforms?
- what problem do memory, skills, permissions, context compression, and error recovery each solve?
- how do terminal backends abstract away the execution environment?
- when should a single-agent system grow into gateway, scheduling, MCP, and voice?

If you can answer those questions clearly and build a similar system yourself, this repo has done its job.

---

**This is not "copy the source code line by line." This is "grasp the designs that truly matter, then build it yourself."**
